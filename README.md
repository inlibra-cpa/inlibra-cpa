### 🌱 Currently Growing In
- Advanced algorithms and data structures (a.k.a. brain gymnastics that sometimes make me question my life choices).
- Microservices architecture to design and maintain distributed systems.
- AI-driven solutions to explore innovative possibilities in tech.
- Exploring software architecture through these incredible books:
  1. <span style="color:green">✔️</span> "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by Martin Kleppmann
  2. "Software Architecture in Practice" by Bass, Clements, Kazman
  3. "Building Evolutionary Architectures" by Ford, Parsons, Kua
  4. "Software Architecture: The Hard Parts" by Ford, Richards, Sadalage, Denghani

Each book brings unique insights into handling data, designing systems, and navigating the complexities of modern architectures. 

### 💡 Fun Facts About Me
